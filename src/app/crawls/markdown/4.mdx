# Overview

My friends were visiting so (of course) we went on a mini food crawl! Chinatown is one of my favorite neighborhoods to grab a quick bite and I especially love to bring visitors here if they only have a few meals to eat during their stay.

# Mei Lai Wah

We started at the crawl at Mei Lai Wash to try their famous roast pork buns. I've been wanting to try these for a while but the line can get quite long. Luckily, it was a weekday so we were able to get our food fairly quickly. The bun did not disappoint!

# West Rice Roll King

Next up, we got some rice rolls at West Rice Roll King. This was pretty tasty, but not as good as the [rice rolls in flushing](/crawls/3#Fu%20Yuan). We got beef, but I heard the egg rice rolls are pretty tasty so I would probably get those next time.

# Shu Jiao Fu Zhou

We went to Shu Jiao Fu Zhou afterward to eat their famous peanut noodles and dumplings. I've been here several times and always enjoy the food. It is super affordable and always busy!

# Harper's Bread House

We made a quick stop at Harper's Bread House to grab some tuna onigiri. This was super comforting. They also have a baked goods section but we were saving room for dessert.

# Spongies

We ended the day at Spongies, a shop that specializes in Hong Kong style sponge cake. The shop had a lot of unique flavors to try, and we settled on Black Sesame and Thai Tea cakes. The cakes were delicious and not too sweet. This was the perfect way to end the crawl!
