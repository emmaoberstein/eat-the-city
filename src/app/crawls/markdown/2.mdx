# Overview

For our second _Eat the City_ food crawl, we decided to try several restaurants in Astoria, Queens. The food scene in Astoria is incredibly diverse and vibrant. From traditional Greek tavernas to Middle Eastern eateries, the neighborhood embodies a global gastronomic journey. Since we had a pescatarian in our group, this crawl has options for both meat eaters and pescatarians.

# Merguez and Frites

We started the day off at [Merguez and Frites](https://www.instagram.com/merguez_and_frites/?hl=en) which serves Algerian cuisine. We ordered the restaurant's namesake sandwich as well as a vegetarian chickpea sandwich. The merguez and frites consists of North African Merguez sausages nestled in a baguette alongside crispy French fries. This sandwich really blew us away and we would definitely recommend ordering it!

# Abuqir

Our next stop was Abuqir, an Egyptian seafood restaurant where you get to pick out your fish from the counter and explain how you want it cooked. We ordered our fish 'Egyptian-style' - blackened and covered in spices.

# Al-Sham Sweets & Pastries

At the midpoint of our crawl, we ordered some sweets from [Al-Sham Sweets & Pastries](https://al-sham-sweets-pastries.business.site/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral), a Middle Eastern bakery. We got a variety of baklavas and a slice of knafeh.
