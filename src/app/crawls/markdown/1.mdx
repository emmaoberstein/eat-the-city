# Overview

For our first _Eat the City_ food crawl, we went to Jackson Heights in Queens, one of the most culturally diverse neighborhoods in New York. The food scene here reflects that diversity, with plenty of reasonably priced and delicious options for South Asian, Southeast Asian, South American, and Mexican dishes within less than a mile from each other!

# Fuskahouse_NYC

The first stop on our crawl, [Fuskahouse_NYC](https://www.instagram.com/fuskahouse_nyc) is a food cart that specializes in Bangladeshi street food. Fuska (also spelled fuchka or phuchka) are deep-fried potato balls seasoned with aromatic spices, offering a satisfying crispy outside and a creamy inside. Topped with tangy tamarind sauce, onions, potato, and shredded boiled eggs, each bite is packed with flavor! We liked the dish and would definitely come back to try other items on the menu, but we knew we had a long day of eating ahead of us.

# Lhasa Fast Food

Next, we headed to [Lhasa Fast Food](https://lhasafastfoodny.com/), a Tibetan restaurant 3 blocks down. We sat outside and ordered Chicken Thenthuk, a traditional Tibetan noodle soup with hand pulled noodles, ear mushroom, cabbage, and glass noodles. A single soup is not the easiest dish for four people to split, but luckily the restaurant was kind enough to give us individual bowls for sharing!

# Arepa Lady

[Arepa Lady](https://www.thearepalady.com/) started in Jackson Height and has expanded to several locations in the city. The restaurant is run by Maria Piedad Cano, affectionately known as the 'Arepa Lady.' With several options to choose from, including chorizo, sirloin and chicken, we opted for the cheese arepa de choclo (sweet corn cakes stuffed with cheese).

# La Nueva Bakery

As we reached the midpoint of our crawl, we were craving some sweets and [La Nueva Bakery](https://www.lanuevabakery.com/) was the perfect next stop! Serving Colombian and Argentine pastries since 1990, La Nueva Bakery had a display case full of incredible treats. We ordered the alfajor (dulce de leche sandwich cookie rolled in coconut), tres leche cake, and a couple of croissants. We also ordered a coffee for the mid-day slump.

# Mariscos El Submarino

[Mariscos El Submarino](https://www.mariscoselsubmarino.com/) is famous for its amazing aguachile, a special dish that comes from the coastal areas of Mexico and has a delicious combination of fresh ingredients and spicy flavors. We ordered the shrimp agauchile.

# Louie's

For a change of pace, we headed to [Louie's](https://www.instagram.com/louiespizza) for some pizza. We shared a grandma slice and thought it was delicious!

# Nepali Bhanchha Ghar

We came to [Nepali Bhanchha Ghar](https://www.bhanchhagharnyc.com/) for their famous momos, but we were really blown away by the sel roti! Sel Roti is a traditional Nepali sweet, ring-shaped rice flour bread with a crispy exterior and a soft, subtly sweet interior, often flavored with spices like cardamom. We really loved the taste and enjoyed the video displayed that taught us about how the dish is made.
