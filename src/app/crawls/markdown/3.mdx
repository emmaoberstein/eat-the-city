# Fu Yuan

We started our day with steamed rice noodle rolls at Fu Yuan, a small takeout window. These were super affordable and delicious. We ordered beef, chicken & corn, and watercress rolls. The beef roll was our favorite.

# Sweet Cake

For something sweet, we headed to an Asian Bakery called Sweet Cake. This bakery had so many unique options that we were excited to try. We decided to order the osmanthus cheesecake, the sesame earl grey cake, and the ube brown sugar mochi puff. The desserts were tasty and not too sweet.

# Kong Sihk Tong

Our next stop was Kong Sihk Tong, a Hong Kong style cafe. We ordered the famous golden lava french toast. For savory options, we opted for the baked fried rice with chicken chop and the curry beef brisket over rice.

# Hindu Temple Canteen

Lastly, we headed to a Hindu temple to eat a meal in the basement canteen. This was a really cool experience, and the food was great as well! We ordered paneer butter masala dosa, poori chole, and masala vada. The food was a bit spicy, which we enjoyed.
